        content (or product) posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their
        possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for

      </p>

      <h4>SECTION 15 - SEVERABILITY</h4>

      provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable

      enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>
